# RS41-D RS92-D decoder
### WORK IN PROGRESS

Vaisala RS41-D and RS92-D* radiosonde transmits data in 1680MHz band. Its hardware doesn't incorporate any positioning system, so we can receive only PTU (pressure, temperature and humidity measurements).

Following data is relevant for both types:
 - Tunning range      1668,6 - 1689,8 MHz
 - Output power (high-power mode)  200 mW
 - Modulation       GFSK; Manchester code
 - Windfinding is provided by Radiotheodolite system
