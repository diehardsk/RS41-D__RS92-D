## GNU Radio Companion flowgraph
GNU Radio Companion helped me to find where the frame payload and Reed-Solomon code is located and also to try out which method it was generated by.
Manchester decoder in this flowgraph is far from perfect and it requires fairly good quality record preferably with 48kHz sampling rate.

Serial protocol decoding and packet byte order reversing is done by custom python blocks. Frames that fails R-S error correction/detection are dropped. In fact they might contain good data blocks. Both RAW data and payload of good frames are displayed by Time raster sink blocks. Then CRC of data blocks is checked and they are printed to console.
